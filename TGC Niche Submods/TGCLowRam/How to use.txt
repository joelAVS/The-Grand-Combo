1 - Install and run TGC normally one time, 
2 - Copy the "CompressedFlagCache.zip" file from this folder
3 - Go to your flag cache folder, at "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\TGC\gfx\flags"
4 - Paste the "CompressedFlagCache.zip" file you copied inside said folder
5 - Unpack the contents of the .zip into the /flags folder, replacing any file

Done! Now just run your game normally! You will notice a 500mb reduction in ram usage.

You can skip the first step and create all folders manually. 

Expect your game to crash at the couple times you start the mod after adding the flags, that's normal, it can happen up to 6 times.
